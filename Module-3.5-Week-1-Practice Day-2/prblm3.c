Problem Statement

You've learned about variables, right? Now its time to practice them. You need to take an integer A, a very big integer B, a floating value C and a character D as input and output them serially.

Input Format

First line will contain A
Second line will contain B
Third line will contain C
Fourth line will contain D

Constraints
-10^9 <= A <= 10^9
-10^18 <= B <= 10^18
-10^9 <= C <= 10^9

Output Format
Output them serially and put a new line after each value. Output the floating value 2 points after decimal.
